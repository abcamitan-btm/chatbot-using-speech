# Voice recognition bot chat

This is how this web app works:

1. Using the Web Speech APIâ€™s `SpeechRecognition` interface to listen your voice from a microphone
2. Send your message to [API.ai](https://api.ai) (the natural language processing platform) as a text string. Using Customer Support as default data.
3. Once the AI from the API.ai returns the reply text back, use the `SpeechSynthesis` interface to give it a synthetic voice.
